        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">We are a small, independent practice that understands the unique challenges and needs of therapists. Our mission is to support you in growing your practice, connecting with clients, and building a thriving professional community.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">We know that running a practice is about more than just finding clients—it's about building relationships, sharing knowledge, and supporting each other. That's why Therapy Connected is designed to be more than a directory: it's a platform for connection, learning, and growth.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">With your support, we plan to expand Therapy Connected to include features like LinkedIn-style networking, peer-to-peer communication, and more practice-level support tools. Our vision is to create a space where therapists can collaborate, share resources, and grow together.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">Thank you for being part of our journey. We are here to listen, adapt, and build the tools you need to succeed—because when therapists thrive, so do the communities they serve.</p>
